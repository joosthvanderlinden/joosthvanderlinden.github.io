This post summarizes my notes from a brief detour during my PhD to study causality and conditional independence. At the time, we had just finished a piece of research on identifying the *most relevant* and *least redundant* set of features for a prediction problem related to fluid flow in porous media. I then wondered if Probabilistic Graphical Models could provide even more rigorous (perhaps even causal) statistical relationships. I concluded, in the end, that causality was beyond reach due to a lack of causal sufficiency in our data. Establishing conditional independence might have been feasible, but at the time I found that most established methods could not deal with non-Gaussian, continuous data. There have been some exciting developments since then, especially in the area of [additive noise models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6779).
