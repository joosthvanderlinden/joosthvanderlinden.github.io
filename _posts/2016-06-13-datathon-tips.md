There is a lot of help available on running traditional hackathons (like [this](http://hackdaymanifesto.com/) page) but very little guidance tailored to running a hackathon for data science. Therefore, I am sharing my experiences here in hopes of helping other data-enthusiasts getting started. Check out the [overview video](http://joosthvanderlinden.github.io/datathon-video/) for a quick intro.

Update: I've uploaded a collection of planning documents and templates to help you get started [here](https://github.com/joosthvanderlinden/organizing_a_datathon).

## Concept
The concept is simple. You provide the dataset; participants provide insights. What is the value in the data? What are the business opportunities? What corporate or societal problems can we solve with this data? What could the data be connected with to create new insights? Outcomes may include visualizations, insights into specific variables, predictions or analyses involving external datasets. It is up to you to decide how specific you want the theme and associated objectives to be. One possibility is to refrain from asking any specific questions. While this practice may be the reality of many data science consulting jobs, the risk of an open-ended "fishing expedition" (or, in this case, a "fishing competition") is a lack of useful insights in the submissions. The opposite approach is to set very specific objectives, focusing all participant efforts on solving a particular problem related to the data. We have found that for the Melbourne Datathon, the best approach is a compromise. In the 2017 edition, we provided a list of "suggested analyses" (provided by the data provider) that were by no means compulsary, and saw a significant improvement in the quality (i.e. usefulness) of the submissions. Interestingly, however, the winner in 2017 did not pursue a question from this list, demonstrating the benefit of having some freedom in the competition.

### Length
Traditional hackathons are often run over the course of a weekend. We decided against this. While it might work for you, we found that the process of data discovery takes a bit longer. As part of the competition, data needs to be cleaned and pre-processed before you can start to analyze something, and that doesn't even take into account "understanding" the various variables involved. If your datathon has a specific theme with some pre-defined objectives, and if your data is relatively clean and transparent, then a weekend might work for you. If you ask no specific questions, then my advice is to run the datathon over the course of one to three weeks, depending on the number of variables and rows in the data. 

### Competitions
The Melbourne Datathon has so far consisted of two competitions: a traditial Kaggle "prediction" competition, and a pitching competition. In the former, the objective is to predict one of the variables in the dataset. For example, in the Melbourne Datathon 2016, we asked participants to predict whether or not a job was a hospitality job, based on the location, salary range, job description etc. In 2017, the goal was to predict the probability that a patient would be dispensed a drug related to diabetes, using postcode, age, gender and past prescriptions. We hosted the competition on [Kaggle In Class](https://inclass.kaggle.com/). Make sure you hold out part of the data to score each prediction. In the pitching competition, the objective is to come up with new insights. Participants submit a slide deck, visually explaining their ideas. Such insights may include an anlysis of a specific variable, a new way to visualize the data, a geographical analysis, time series, prediction, segmentation, you name it. Next, the data owner and/or an industry panel consisting of data science "executives" assesses the entries and picks a top 5. The top 5 teams pitch their analysis to the panel and an audience on the final night of the datathon, after which the panel decides the top 3.

### Events
The Melbourne Datathon consists of four events: launch day, hackday(s), submission day and the pitch night:

- **Launch day**. I consider this optional, but it helps to create some buzz and get people excited. During the launch event (either over lunch or right after work hours) we share a "sneak-peek" data file, containing a small subset of the full dataset. Participants are not required to attend the launch event, but many will to get an early start. The launch event is also an opportunity to quickly run through the schedule and answer questions. We deliberately did not share anything about the data itself during our launch event, to give people a chance to discover the structure themselves. Lastly, launch day is an opportunity for people to sign the non-disclosure agreement (NDA), if you have one. We cross-checked NDAs against our online signup and emailed participants the sneak-peek file. Alternatively, to keep things simple, you can also give out the full dataset on launch day.
- **Hackday**. The hackday is the main event of the datathon. First and foremost, you should share the full dataset and organize a data walkthrough (run by your data owner) to explain all variables involved. Second, you should offer the space for teams to form and work together. If your datathon attracts a lot of "beginners" (close to 50% in our case) then running a series of tutorials is a good idea. At a minimum, I recommend a tutorial on loading and plotting the data in R/Python, and a tutorial on how to present data insights. You can also have some mentors floating around to help answer questions about the data and running an analysis in R or Python. In the 2017 edition of the Melbourne Datathon, we ran two hackdays (in consecutive weekends) to keep the momentum going.
- **Submission day**. After hackday, teams go home and continue to work on their entries until the submission deadline. Directly after the submission deadline, have your data owner and/or industry panel assess the entries and pick a top 5. Next, communicate the top 5 to your participants. 
- **Pitch night**. The pitch night is the conclusion of the datathon. Five selected teams pitch their ideas to an audience of participants and non-participants, as well as the industry panel. After the presentation, each panel member ranks the pitches. We also ran an [audience vote](http://www.voxvote.com/) to give the audience a say about the winners. A (weighted) average of the panel and audience ranking will provide the final scores. Prizes are subsequently awarded during the award ceremony. If you have the budget, a small afterparty at your local pub is also a good idea. 

## Tips and lessons learned

### Pitching to potential (data) sponsors
Unless you already have a dataset when you decide to organize a datathon, finding a previously unreleased dataset can be challenging. I have found that government departments are reluctant to release their data due to political bagage and the risks of anything "bad" being exposed, while our efforts to obtain a corporate dataset often ended at the legal department.

That being said, there are a lot of benefits for a company/institution/government department to become your "data sponsor" and share their data with you. The data will be analyzed by a group of enthusiastic data scientists, and you would be surprised to see how many different angles are taken. Despite receiving 20-50 submissions in the Melbourne Datathon, we did not see any two teams doing the same thing. Moreover, having no previous knowledge of the data often helps people think "out of the box." The data sponsor also gets significant brand exposure and the opportunity to network and recruit. 

In the Melbourne Datathon, we have so far only worked with corporate datasets. From our side, we require that the corporate sponsors pays for the prize money. This is really important because it takes away (to some degree) the impression that the datathon is "free labour." The only requirement from our corporate data sponsor has been that participants sign a non-disclosure agreement. Make sure you negotiate that participants retain the intellectual property rights on their code, and ask the data sponsor to set up the NDA between them and the participant (instead of you, to avoid legal risks). For the submitted insights, we ask for an irrevocable, non-exclusive (!), royalty-free and perpetual right to use, modify, distribute to the public, and publicly display the content of the submission, for both the organisers (to show next year's participants what a winning submission looks like) and the data providers (to use the ideas). 

### Things to look for in a dataset
For a succesful competition, you want a rich and granular dataset. Our criteria for a good dataset for a datathon are:

- A **people** element, e.g. users, customers, participants, drivers, etc.
- A **time** element
- A **place** element, e.g. latitutde/longitude, city, country
- **Raw** data, e.g. granular, not aggregated
- Previously **unreleased** data, e.g. with no answers/questions on the internet
- **Medium-sized** data, e.g. 2-8 GB, should fit (at least partially) in memory on people's laptops
- (optional) **local** data, e.g. from your city, state, country

Regardless of the size, the data should be cut up into manageable chunks, so that everyone can load at least part of the data. That way, everyone can get started on their laptop, and the more eager participants can go nuts with their database.

### Budgeting for a free event 
The Melbourne Datathon has so far been a free event. If you run your datathon for free as well, take into account that a lot of registrated participants will not show up. In 2015, we saw roughly 50% of our online registrations show up, in 2016 it was closer to 60% and in 2017 it was 75%. Although it is hard to say what works, I recommend budgeting for 50% no-shows. Make sure your venue is large enough and only cap registrations if you really have to. A flexible pizza order (if you provide lunch on hackday) is definitely desired, if possible. During the Great Pizza Shortage of 2016, we had to place a second order on the spot.

## Other advice
- How you go about **transferring the full dataset** to the participants depends on the requirements set by your data owner. In all editions so far, we have gone with a low-tech, low-risk approach: put the data on USB sticks, attach the USB sticks to a large table dubbed the "data station," and point people there to copy the data to their laptop. I received a lot of positive feedback for this approach, because you don't have to mess around with a database. Make sure you attach the USB sticks to the table, or there will be none left at the end.
- On your **website**, I recommend setting up a *why* (run this competition), *what* (is a datathon), *when* (is it taking place), *where* (is it taking place) and *who* (is involved) section, followed by a signup form. A FAQ (what to bring? how to find a team? what is an NDA?) is helpful too. Make sure to thank your sponsors.
- For **communication** via email, I recommend MailChimp. Importing lists of email addresses (from your signup) is super easy, and any email templates that you create can be reused. Grouping participants is also really useful.
- Because most of our participants find us through our local data science Meetup group, we mainly use **social media** to answer questions and post some updates. During the event, a Slack channel is a great way to have participants post code, ideas and questions. If you are looking for more participants than Facebook and Twitter are obviously a great place to start. Post regular updates about your preparations and useful tutorials for participants to prepare for your datathon.
- Get a good **photographer**. Pictures will help you promote your event next time, and can be send to sponsors/participants in post-event thank you messages.
- To make the pitch night a little bit more interactive, set up an **audience vote** (for example, [here](http://www.voxvote.com/)) and include the result in the final ranking.
- Make sure you set some **judging criteria** for your industry panel. Teamwork is a good example. Communicate the criteria to your participants at the start of the event.
- The best advice I got from someone was to make the event run itself. Questions from participants can often be answered by other participants, for example, if you set up a way to communicate with each other (Slack channel). The USB data station is a great, fool-proof way to share the data. Give a heads up about everything (e.g. seats and pizza are first come, first serve) to pre-empt dissapointment. Brief all your volunteers and provide a role book. It's going to be hectic regardless, so the less you have to worry about while it runs, the better.

That's about it. Any questions? Feel free to get in touch. Good luck!
