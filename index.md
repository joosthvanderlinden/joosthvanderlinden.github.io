I am an applied mathematician at heart, interested in data science, engineering and software development. I enjoy traveling, a clean inbox and a minimal website.

Currently, I work as a Sr. Data Scientist for [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/). Our team helps improve current and future generations of Dexcom's products by extracting insights from one of the largest healthcare technology datasets in the world. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Our Community](https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/), extracting insights from social sector data, such as grants and donations, and building products to make it easier for community groups to raise funds. I completed my Engineering PhD at The University of Melbourne. I studied fluid flow and heat flow in granular media using graph-theoretical techniques and machine learning. I also founded and organized the [Melbourne Datathon](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon) for the past three years. Previously, I completed my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics at Delft University of Technology. I interned at IBM and Schlumberger, working in scientific computing.
