I am an applied mathematician at heart, interested in data science, engineering and software development. I enjoy traveling, a clean inbox and a minimal website.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist for [Our Community](https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/). My team extracts insights from social sector data, such as grants and donations, and builds products to make it easier for community groups to raise funds. I recently submitted my Engineering PhD thesis for examination, at The University of Melbourne. I studied fluid flow and heat flow in granular media using complex networks and machine learning. I also founded and organized the [Melbourne Datathon](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon) for the past three years. Previously, I completed my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics at Delft University of Technology. I interned at IBM and Schlumberger, working in scientific computing.
