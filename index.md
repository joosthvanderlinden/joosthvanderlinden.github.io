I am an applied mathematician at heart, interested in engineering, data science and software development. I enjoy traveling, a clean inbox and a minimal website.

Currently, I am a PhD student in Engineering at The University of Melbourne. I study complex networks and machine learning in granular media. On the side, I organize the [Melbourne Datathon](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon) and I work as a data scientist for [Our Community](https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/). Previously, I completed my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics at Delft University of Technology. I interned at IBM and Schlumberger, working in scientific computing.
