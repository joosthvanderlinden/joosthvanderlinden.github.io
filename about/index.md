My passion is to combine applied mathematics and coding in engineering and data science applications. I excel in environments with ample learning opportunities. Currently, I am lucky enough to build on all of these things in my PhD.

**Summary**

I discovered my passion for data science by working as a data analyst for a Dutch railway company, analyzing sensor and contractor data, and as data scientist for Our Community, analyzing grant and donation data. I founded and co-organize the [Melbourne Datathon](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon) which attracted 120 data enthusiasts in the first year, over 300 in the second year, and over 500 in our 2017 edition.

- Cum laude BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics from The Delft University of Technology.
- Currently working towards a PhD at The University of Melbourne, applying machine learning and complex networks to granular, porous media.
- Research internships at Schlumberger, IBM and for a small energy consultant (Alboran), where I learned how to connect, communicate and collaborate.
- Data analytics experience at Keyrail (railway operator), working with sensor data, performance data and dashboards. 
- Data science experience at Our Community (software company and social enterprise), performing predictive modeling, time series analysis, AB experiments, text analytics, survey analysis and dashboard design.
