[//]: <> (Ethnography of Data: learning about the social context behind our data. Include qualitative insights and treat systems less like an “experimental black box”.)

I enjoy combining applied mathematics and software development for engineering and data science applications. I have been fortunate enough to build on all of these passions as a Senior Data Scientist at [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/) and in my prior positions as a Data Scientist at [Our Community](https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/) and as a PhD student at The Univeristy of Melbourne. I developed my passion for data science by working as a Data Analyst for a Dutch railway company, analyzing sensor and contractor data. I founded and co-organized the [Melbourne Datathon](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon) which attracted 120 data enthusiasts in the first year, over 300 in the second year, over 500 in our 2017 edition, and has since [grown even further](https://twitter.com/girlvsdata/status/1044785749151768576/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Eembeddedtimeline%7Ctwterm%5Ecollection%3A1048040829149835264&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgirlvsdata.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2F08%2Fmy-first-hackathon-dsm-datathon-part-2%2F).

- Cum laude BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics from The Delft University of Technology, with a focus on scientific computing.
- PhD from The University of Melbourne, applying machine learning and graph-theoretical techniques to fluid flow and heat transfer granular, porous media.
- Research internships at Schlumberger, IBM and for a small energy consultant (Alboran), where I learned how to connect, communicate and collaborate.
- Data analytics experience at Keyrail (railway operator), working with sensor data, performance data and dashboards. 
- Data science experience at Our Community (software company and social enterprise), performing predictive modeling, time series analysis, AB experiments, text analytics, survey analysis, dashboard design & more.
- Currently, I am a Sr. Data Scientist at Dexcom (healthcare technology), where I mainly focuss on retention and churn models.
