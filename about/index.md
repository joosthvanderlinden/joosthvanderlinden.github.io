[//]: <> (Ethnography of Data: learning about the social context behind our data. Include qualitative insights and treat systems less like an “experimental black box”.)

I enjoy combining applied mathematics and software development for engineering and data science applications. Currently, I am lucky enough to build on all of these things in my PhD and job as a Data Scientist. I developed my passion for data science by working as a data analyst for a Dutch railway company, analyzing sensor and contractor data. I founded and co-organized the [Melbourne Datathon](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon) which attracted 120 data enthusiasts in the first year, over 300 in the second year, and over 500 in our 2017 edition.

- Cum laude BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics from The Delft University of Technology.
- Currently working towards a PhD at The University of Melbourne, applying machine learning and complex networks to granular, porous media.
- Research internships at Schlumberger, IBM and for a small energy consultant (Alboran), where I learned how to connect, communicate and collaborate.
- Data analytics experience at Keyrail (railway operator), working with sensor data, performance data and dashboards. 
- Data science experience at Our Community (software company and social enterprise), performing predictive modeling, time series analysis, AB experiments, text analytics, survey analysis and dashboard design.
